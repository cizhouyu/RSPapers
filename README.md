# Recommender System Papers 推荐系统论文
**Recent(2019-2023)** papers about Recommender Systems at top-tier conferences\*.

Based on individual research interests, I collected and created mind maps from the following two lists of papers:

1. Papers from top-tier conferences\* in the field of recommender systems in recent years (2019-2023) with a focus on topics such as **recommendation bias, fairness, diversity, cold-start problems**, and **ensemble methods**.

2. Best papers from top data mining conferences\* in recent years (2020-2023), particularly those related to recommender systems.

I hope this can help researchers interested in these fields save time on their searches. 

❤️**Contributions and suggestions for high-quality papers that may have been overlooked are also greatly appreciated, especially those related to the areas mentioned in point 1.**

*\* top-tier conferences: KDD, NIPS, SIGIR, ICML, ICLR, IJCAI, WWW, CIKM, WSDM, RecSys.*
